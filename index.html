<b>2022-09-22: L-Tyrosine First Results</b>
  <p>Today I took 1000mg of L-tyrosine in the morning, and waited for about an hour for it to take effect. I have noticed nothing, though my motivation levels have plummeted. I have read that the supplement takes a couple days to actually take effect in some people, so I'm going to continue supplementing it for about a week or two. It may negatively affect hormone production, so there is inherent risk. If it does not incur an increase in drive, I will quit immediately.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Monastic Training for Knowledge Workers</b>
  <p>Most kinds of work benefit from workers having better concentration. They also take damage from workers having worse concentration. As Cal Newport has shown in his book <i>Deep Work</i>, this is especially important in knowledge work. Concentration can be trained simply by concentrating intensely for long periods of time. In the Middle Ages, Europe was populated by monasteries - centers where intellectuals spent all their time in deep concentration. College should be training modern knowledge workers to concentrate at the highest level possible, but instead it does...something else. The material in any college major could be learned in less than a year of intense study, so why do we spend more than that on it? By compressing college down, we would simultaneously train people in concentration. There's a 10x improvement waiting to occur in education, but there's no impetus to herald it.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Writing/Balance</b>
  <p>Writing seems to require two things: talent, and erudition. The talent part is innate, and a sine qua non, but if you start with only a little bit of talent, you can get better. Writing is a culture of subskills. Some people are really good at only one subskill, and they still perform well as writers. If you work really hard (ie consistent deep, focused work), you can get a <i>lot</i> better generally or at a few subskills, and have a chance of making it somewhere. The time you spend writing, however, is time you cannot spend reading. If you want people to take you seriously, you have to bring really good arguments to the table, and that requires you at least know a lot about the world. <i>Reading</i> itself is also a culture of subskills. Maybe you're good at digesting technical textbooks, but bad at digesting complex, emotional literature. You can still write review articles or papers, and do just fine. My approach so far to gaining erudition has been to order as many books as I can from the library, heave them in a pile on my desk, and stare at them disconsolately because I do not have the motivation to read them. A better approach, now that I think about it, would be to find what subskill of reading I excel at, and to focus relentlessly on that. Perhaps I could do the same for writing. Both investigations require effort and thought. One potential problem with focusing relentlessly on a subskill is domain restriction. It's like gym machines: they often only target one muscle, and so the strength you develop is artificial. To counter act this, perhaps spend at least a third of your time building up general skill. More on this later, when I figure out what subskills of writing/reading I'm paticularly good at.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: John von Neumann</b>
  <p>John von Neumann may have been the smartest man to have ever lived. If perhaps a third of the stories told about him contain a drop of veracity, then an army of von Neumann clones would obsolete huge swaths of academia. I will build this army. The clones will have buzz cuts. They will know martial arts. Together, we will found a new country, replete with gleaming skyscrapers of human bone and ziggurats of clay made from the ashes of our enemies. We will build a space base in space, and swarm the galaxy like hornets. They will each learn to play Uno with perfect game theory, and we will become rich by winning Uno tournaments.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Better calculations</b>
  <p>What I meant to say, but probably didn't express right in the last post was that dopamine (or something else) (might) allow for those willpower calculations to take more things into account (ie the future), leading to more motivation for low-reward, but necessary activities.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Motivation, entropy, and L-tyrosine</b>
  <p>Scott Alexander proposed that will power follows some kind of Bayesian calculus – the different activities you could be doing have a different "weights" assigned to them, and you end up doing whatever has the most total weight. Maybe dopamine is a kind of "energy" that recalculates weight assignment, and without it, immediately high-reward things become more appealing, while immediately low-reward (but possibly necessary) things get overlooked. If you don't have a lot of dopamine, weight will find high-reward activities like water finds a storm drain. If you have a lot of work due, but you don't have a lot of dopamine, the calculation won't go right, and you'll procastinate and do immediately highly-rewarding things (ie playing videogames, writing blogs [ahem]) instead of getting your work done. If you have high dopamine, then you should be able to calculate those weights with higher fidelity, overlook the hyperbolic discounting, and get your work done. This may be overemphasizing the role of dopamine, and it may be totally wrong (I'm not a neuroscientist). But if it's true, we should expect increasing dopamine levels to give more gravity to short-term unfun, low-reward, necessary activities, and reduce procastination. I've been procastinating on some work, and setting up morning routines that I want to follow, but just don't have enough weight on to establish, might increasing L-dopa make a difference? Might I better be able to sum up those weights? I'm going to try supplementing 1000mg of L-tyrosine (a precursor to dopamine) to see if it makes a difference, and I will report the results back here.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Silence and getting people to like you</b>
  <p>Conversations are often filled with verbal noise. If you can cut out noise from your own input, it might make people like you more. Blurting out jokes doesn't work very well, and does the opposite of what's intended. I've been told that due to my social incongruence, I make people laugh when I <i>don't try to be funny</i>. A paticularly salient example of this occured when I asked Christian Kanye fan if calling Kanye West "Yesus" was blasphemy. This input produced paroxysms of laughter in my peers, unmirrored by religious whale puns.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Things become fun once you get good at them</b>
  <p>Yesterday, I went to a free meditation class at my local Zen center. The teacher had us sit for about twenty minutes, split up by some dharmic theory and instruction. One student complained that their mind was like a whirlwind, and they couldn't focus on their breath for too long. The teacher nodded, and said that the experience of meditation changes considerably once you've practiced for a while.</p>
  <p>Almost every activity with a learning curve is like this. Music is a drag when you're new to it, but once you become adept enough to enter flow states, the experience changes – it becomes fun. Aside from enjoyment, some kinds of talent only express themselves at high skill levels. It's known that IQ becomes a worse predictor of chess ability as players get better, perhaps more things are like this. There's a hurdle in front of most things worth doing, and jumping over it mainly requires that you believe that something's behind it.</p>
