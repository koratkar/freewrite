  <b>2022-09-21: Things become fun once you get good at them</b>
  <p>Yesterday, I went to a free meditation class at my local Zen center. The teacher had us sit for about twenty minutes, split up by some dharmic theory and instruction. One student complained that their mind was like a whirlwind, and they couldn't focus on their breath for too long. The teacher nodded, and said that the experience of meditation changes considerably once you've practiced for a while.</p>
  <p>Almost every activity with a learning curve is like this. Music is a drag when you're new to it, but once you become adept enough to enter flow states, the experience changes â€“ it becomes fun.</p>
  <p>Aside from enjoyment, some kinds of talent only express themselves at high skill levels. It's known that IQ becomes a worse predictor of chess ability as players get better, perhaps more things are like this.</p>
  <p>There's a hurdle in front of most things worth doing, and getting across it mainly requires that you believe that something's behind it.</p>
