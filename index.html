<b>2022-09-21: Motivation, entropy, and L-tyrosine</b>
  <p>Scott Alexander proposed that will power follows some kind of Bayesian calculus – the different activities you could be doing have a different "weights" assigned to them, and you end up doing whatever has the most total weight. Maybe dopamine is a kind of "energy" that recalculates weight assignment, and without it, immediately high-reward things become more appealing, while immediately low-reward (but possibly necessary) things get overlooked. If you don't have a lot of dopamine, weight will find high-reward activities like water finds a storm drain. If you have a lot of work due, but you don't have a lot of dopamine, the calculation won't go right, and you'll procastinate and do immediately highly-rewarding things (ie playing videogames, writing blogs [ahem]) instead of getting your work done. If you have high dopamine, then you should be able to calculate those weights with higher fidelity, overlook the hyperbolic discounting, and get your work done. This may be overemphasizing the role of dopamine, and it may be totally wrong (I'm not a neuroscientist). But if it's true, we should expect increasing dopamine levels to give more gravity to short-term unfun, low-reward, necessary activities, and reduce procastination. I've been procastinating on some work, and setting up morning routines that I want to follow, but just don't have enough weight on to establish, might increasing L-dopa make a difference? Might I better be able to sum up those weights? I'm going to try supplementing 1000mg of L-tyrosine (a precursor to dopamine) to see if it makes a difference, and I will report the results back here.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Silence and getting people to like you</b>
  <p>Conversations are often filled with verbal noise. If you can cut out noise from your own input, it might make people like you more. Blurting out jokes doesn't work very well, and does the opposite of what's intended. I've been told that due to my social incongruence, I make people laugh when I <i>don't try to be funny</i>. A paticularly salient example of this occured when I asked Christian Kanye fan if calling Kanye West "Yesus" was blasphemy. This input produced paroxysms of laughter in my peers, unmirrored by religious whale puns.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Things become fun once you get good at them</b>
  <p>Yesterday, I went to a free meditation class at my local Zen center. The teacher had us sit for about twenty minutes, split up by some dharmic theory and instruction. One student complained that their mind was like a whirlwind, and they couldn't focus on their breath for too long. The teacher nodded, and said that the experience of meditation changes considerably once you've practiced for a while.</p>
  <p>Almost every activity with a learning curve is like this. Music is a drag when you're new to it, but once you become adept enough to enter flow states, the experience changes – it becomes fun. Aside from enjoyment, some kinds of talent only express themselves at high skill levels. It's known that IQ becomes a worse predictor of chess ability as players get better, perhaps more things are like this. There's a hurdle in front of most things worth doing, and jumping over it mainly requires that you believe that something's behind it.</p>
