<b>2022-09-25: Blunting Novelty Search</b>
  <p>Digital media makes us sort of addicted to novelty. YouTube provides an endless stream of variagted content. Email provides an endless stream of potentially interesting leads. Blogs provide an endless stream of cool ideas. Even limiting your exposure is not enough. I think you have to institute some kind of hermitude to find novelty in following your everyday routine. It doesn't take too long to lower your "novelty threshold" - maybe a couple days or so. It might even be instantaneous! In a distraction free enviornment, I notice a much greater ability to focus.</p>

<b>2022-09-25: L-Tyrsosine Day 4</b>
  <p>I felt more motivated to do things I usually don't do without willpower today. I think the effect is improving. I'll try supplementing 2000mg someday to notice a difference.</p>

<b>2022-09-23: Common Rationality</b>
  <p>Smart people try to move closer to their goals. Average people do the same. The difference is in goal design. Geniuses make decisions which smart and average people interpret as nonsensical, destructive, and counterintuitive - until the results come in. Good chess AIs play like human players, but better. The best chess AIs play unlike any human does, and their decisions look stupid - until they win.</p>
  <p>This effect isn't limited to geniuses and super computers. If you think about any topic for five minutes, or read a couple books about it, that puts you far above the population average. You seem wrong to most. Sometimes your interpretation of an idea will diverge substantially from everyone else's. People might react emotionally. To account for this, pay attention to how people use words, and avoid literal interpretation. People don't mean what you mean! Replace your term set with brief explanations of the topic. Instead of using a word like "causality" during a debate about free will, use the full explanation: "some things antecede other things." Instead of saying "trust", say "believe statements unconditionally".</p>

<b>2022-09-23: What to do in the in-betweens?</b>
  <p>Life is lived in moments of total rapture. Finding an engrossing textbook, and blasting through the problem sets. Reading a page-turner. Watching a good movie. In these moments, our concentration peaks, and nothing can distract us. You can access these high levels of concentration with no stimuli via meditation. On its own, concentration is very blissful, so cultivating it generates a steady stream of joy. That's why I suppose some people call meditation wireheading. I don't disagree, but how does it make meditation a bad thing? Without strong powers of concentration, we exist in "in-betweens" of these awesome experiences, half-lost in thought, half-lost in what we're doing at the moment. Sometimes those periods go on very long. I've wondered what to dedicate myself to while not focusing intensely on something. I think the answer is meditation. Not insight meditation, but relentless training in concentration. Once you can achieve flow states easily, then it should reduce the average in-between length even further. Let's see how this goes.</p>

<b>2022-09-23: L-Tyrosine Day 2</b>
  <p>Today was better than yesterday motivationally, but I'm not sure if that's related to the tyrosine. I've come to a new understanding of how motivation works (internally), and it's much less dependent on complicated models. See, yesterday I spent the whole day in a restless lethargic torpor, but then I found an essay competition, and boundless energy sprang into me ex nihilo. For hours, I researched and typed up what I thought turned out to be a pretty fine submission for the contest in a ratpous state I've spent months trying to trigger elsewhere than writing. It's not that I don't <i>want</i> to do homework, or read more books, but it's that something about motivation is so context dependent that I never feel like doing those activities (unless the homework is due soon, or I'm reading a paticularly good book). I read <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rbXoZFWdwaP4pW9hu/intrinsic-motivation-is-crucial-for-overcoming-akrasia">this post</a> on LessWrong yesterday, and breathed a sigh of relief. Motivation is not about hacking our reward functions! It's about finding activities worth doing! If you can't bring yourself to exercise, then find a type of exercise you like! Sure, there might be a hurdle associated with some activities – they become much more fun once you're good at them, but for everything I recall jumping that hurdle for (setting up development enviornments, learning new software, getting into the flow of a novel), I don't recall associated will power expenditure. They were just so exciting that I couldn't help but learn! Much, much more on this when I figure out how to make productive activities "so fun they can't be ignored" (or find out activities of which this is an intrinsic quality).</p>

<b>2022-09-22: Reward system as prison</b>
  <p>I've come to find the human reward function - and everything else related to willpower, to be a kind of prison. We don't control it - because there is no 'we' at the bottom of it all to do that. It's maladapted to modern superstimuli (social media, college admissions, the very existence of a career). More existentially, observing it makes it obvious that free will is an illusion. Perhaps it will always be a kind of prison (...as long as you think there's a "you" behind the bars), but maybe we can work with it to some extent. When you're really young, all you want is food and warmth. Once you have some situational awareness, and advertising begins to control your brain (no really, ads are designed to make little children incessantly "nag" their parents for things), the path to fulfilling innate drives becomes material desires. I don't think this changes for most people as they age - it's just that instead of worthless plastic goods, ads instruct you to want worthless 4-year degrees (notice the 6-foot tall mediatronic display in the locker bay - I did you a favor and unplugged it, but some system daemon turned it back on). After college, the programming instructs you to get a job, then a house, and then finally a nuclear family so that Moloch can still vicariously feed on you after it puts you in a nursing home. Um.</p>
  <p>If the reward system makes us miserable when we're plugged in to the mainstream society videogame, then we should plug it into a new videogame. If your happiness is contingent on unachievable or unending goals, then you will never be happy. If it is instead contingent on you <i>doing</i> a certain activity (not <i>achieving</i> something arbitrary) then you'll be able to be happy more often. More on this when I figure out what activities make people happy.</p>

<b>2022-09-22: L-Tyrosine First Results</b>
  <p>Today I took 1000mg of L-tyrosine in the morning, and waited for about an hour for it to take effect. I have noticed nothing, though my motivation levels have plummeted. I have read that the supplement takes a couple days to actually take effect in some people, so I'm going to continue supplementing it for about a week or two. It may negatively affect hormone production, so there is inherent risk. If it does not incur an increase in drive, I will quit immediately.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Monastic Training for Knowledge Workers</b>
  <p>Most kinds of work benefit from workers having better concentration. They also take damage from workers having worse concentration. As Cal Newport has shown in his book <i>Deep Work</i>, this is especially important in knowledge work. Concentration can be trained simply by concentrating intensely for long periods of time. In the Middle Ages, Europe was populated by monasteries - centers where intellectuals spent all their time in deep concentration. College should be training modern knowledge workers to concentrate at the highest level possible, but instead it does...something else. The material in any college major could be learned in less than a year of intense study, so why do we spend more than that on it? By compressing college down, we would simultaneously train people in concentration. There's a 10x improvement waiting to occur in education, but there's no impetus to herald it.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Writing/Balance</b>
  <p>Writing seems to require two things: talent, and erudition. The talent part is innate, and a sine qua non, but if you start with only a little bit of talent, you can get better. Writing is a culture of subskills. Some people are really good at only one subskill, and they still perform well as writers. If you work really hard (ie consistent deep, focused work), you can get a <i>lot</i> better generally or at a few subskills, and have a chance of making it somewhere. The time you spend writing, however, is time you cannot spend reading. If you want people to take you seriously, you have to bring really good arguments to the table, and that requires you at least know a lot about the world. <i>Reading</i> itself is also a culture of subskills. Maybe you're good at digesting technical textbooks, but bad at digesting complex, emotional literature. You can still write review articles or papers, and do just fine. My approach so far to gaining erudition has been to order as many books as I can from the library, heave them in a pile on my desk, and stare at them disconsolately because I do not have the motivation to read them. A better approach, now that I think about it, would be to find what subskill of reading I excel at, and to focus relentlessly on that. Perhaps I could do the same for writing. Both investigations require effort and thought. One potential problem with focusing relentlessly on a subskill is domain restriction. It's like gym machines: they often only target one muscle, and so the strength you develop is artificial. To counter act this, perhaps spend at least a third of your time building up general skill. More on this later, when I figure out what subskills of writing/reading I'm paticularly good at.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: John von Neumann</b>
  <p>John von Neumann may have been the smartest man to have ever lived. If perhaps a third of the stories told about him contain a drop of veracity, then an army of von Neumann clones would obsolete huge swaths of academia. I will build this army. The clones will have buzz cuts. They will know martial arts. Together, we will found a new country, replete with gleaming skyscrapers of human bone and ziggurats of clay made from the ashes of our enemies. We will build a space base in space, and swarm the galaxy like hornets. They will each learn to play Uno with perfect game theory, and we will become rich by winning Uno tournaments.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Better calculations</b>
  <p>What I meant to say, but probably didn't express right in the last post was that dopamine (or something else) (might) allow for those willpower calculations to take more things into account (ie the future), leading to more motivation for low-reward, but necessary activities.</p>	  
	<hr>  
<b>2022-09-21: Motivation, entropy, and L-tyrosine</b>
  <p>Scott Alexander proposed that will power follows some kind of Bayesian calculus – the different activities you could be doing have a different "weights" assigned to them, and you end up doing whatever has the most total weight. Maybe dopamine is a kind of "energy" that recalculates weight assignment, and without it, immediately high-reward things become more appealing, while immediately low-reward (but possibly necessary) things get overlooked. If you don't have a lot of dopamine, weight will find high-reward activities like water finds a storm drain. If you have a lot of work due, but you don't have a lot of dopamine, the calculation won't go right, and you'll procastinate and do immediately highly-rewarding things (ie playing videogames, writing blogs [ahem]) instead of getting your work done. If you have high dopamine, then you should be able to calculate those weights with higher fidelity, overlook the hyperbolic discounting, and get your work done. This may be overemphasizing the role of dopamine, and it may be totally wrong (I'm not a neuroscientist). But if it's true, we should expect increasing dopamine levels to give more gravity to short-term unfun, low-reward, necessary activities, and reduce procastination. I've been procastinating on some work, and setting up morning routines that I want to follow, but just don't have enough weight on to establish, might increasing L-dopa make a difference? Might I better be able to sum up those weights? I'm going to try supplementing 1000mg of L-tyrosine (a precursor to dopamine) to see if it makes a difference, and I will report the results back here.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Silence and getting people to like you</b>
  <p>Conversations are often filled with verbal noise. If you can cut out noise from your own input, it might make people like you more. Blurting out jokes doesn't work very well, and does the opposite of what's intended. I've been told that due to my social incongruence, I make people laugh when I <i>don't try to be funny</i>. A paticularly salient example of this occured when I asked Christian Kanye fan if calling Kanye West "Yesus" was blasphemy. This input produced paroxysms of laughter in my peers, unmirrored by religious whale puns.</p>

<b>2022-09-21: Things become fun once you get good at them</b>
  <p>Yesterday, I went to a free meditation class at my local Zen center. The teacher had us sit for about twenty minutes, split up by some dharmic theory and instruction. One student complained that their mind was like a whirlwind, and they couldn't focus on their breath for too long. The teacher nodded, and said that the experience of meditation changes considerably once you've practiced for a while.</p>
  <p>Almost every activity with a learning curve is like this. Music is a drag when you're new to it, but once you become adept enough to enter flow states, the experience changes – it becomes fun. Aside from enjoyment, some kinds of talent only express themselves at high skill levels. It's known that IQ becomes a worse predictor of chess ability as players get better, perhaps more things are like this. There's a hurdle in front of most things worth doing, and jumping over it mainly requires that you believe that something's behind it.</p>
